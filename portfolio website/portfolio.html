                        <p>For my minor Information Design, I collaborated with two classmates to conceptualize, 
                            design, and code a website. We were tasked by Naturalis with transforming a database 
                            into an engaging design and webpage. Our goal was to visually represent insect data from specific 
                            locations, enabling users to compare them using authentic data.

                                this minor in information design, which focuses on datasets, I centered 
                                my work around transforming an online dataset into insightful visualizations.
